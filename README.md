## Elm Bouncing Box

The first thing I like to do when I encounter a new tool is try to recreate a simple game where a box bounces across the screen. See
[my first implementation with jquery](
https://github.com/benschenker/bouncing-box
).

It uses Elm guided by the amazing tutorials at [elm-lang.org](http://http://elm-lang.org/docs)

The only issue I'm still trying to figure out is how to correctly access the width of the browser from elm so as to make the box bounce the full width of the window.
